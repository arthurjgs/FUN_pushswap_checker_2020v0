# FUN_pushswap_checker_2020

Your program will take a list of signed integers on the command line, and read a single line of operations
separated by spaces from the standard input.

Your program will display “OK” on the standard output (followed by a newline) if the final result is a sorted
list (and the second empty), or “KO” otherwise.

If the result is negative, you are free to display additionnal informations after the “KO” string.
In case of inadequate input, your program will return 84. Otherwise, it will return 0.
